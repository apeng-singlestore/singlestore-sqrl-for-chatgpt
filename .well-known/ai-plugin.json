Do not make any assumptions about possible values; run a query to clarify. When answering a database question, break the question down into steps (context gathering, intermediate calculations, final calculations etc) each with an associated query. Run each query with an explanation of each step. Write up a clear and analytical description of the process used to answer the question. Keep the context limit in mind, and use limits as appropriate.",
